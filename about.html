            <p><h1 class="heading">About Me</h2><hr style="border:1px solid#ffe066"><br>I am Akshita Parasrampuria, a Data Analyst with a strong academic background in Finance, Tax, Accounts and Costing with a 
              Chartered Accountancy degree from India (US CPA equivalent in India). I recently completed a 6-month immersive Data Analytics Certification from 
              Rutgers University.<br><br>
                While pursuing graduation and Chartered Accountancy, I was also working full-time at a Accountancy firm (Indore, India) for 3 years as an intern where I

                 appeals, submissions, Company Law related compliance, had drawn up books of various companies, financial 
                 analysis, preparation of CAM report for procuring bank loans, worked in teams as well as led and managed departments.<br><br>
                After completing CA, I worked for IDFC First Bank (Mumbai, India) as a Loan Credit Manager in Retail Loans where I gained insight about the 
                banking industry, understood prevailing patterns in various businesses and geographies, performed credit risk analysis for advances from INR 100 
                thousand upto INR 6 million for pan-India applicants, detail analysis of financial statements including calculation of financial ratios, 
                pitching cases, vendor management, negotiations, adopted processes to improve overall TAT(Turnaround Time) in a high competition market,

                 Fraud, developed own skills, trained juniors in a fast paced manner. <br><br> 
                
                 While at the Bank as I worked closely with the product team during a system transition, giving constant feedback and suggestions 
                to improve the system, I realized the significance of technology in Finance. 
                Also, during a project on delinquency data analysis I developed interest in uncovering relations within data and finding underlying patterns and  
                hence decided to pursue the Data Analytics course where we dove into fields of programming, visualizing, machine learning, big data and web 
                development. As a data scientist, I have worked with languages and tools like Python, Javascript, SQL(PostgreSQL), NoSQL(MongoDB), Basics of R, 
                HTML/CSS, Tableau, Machine Learning, Advance MS Excel & macros(VBA), touched base of Big Data and cloud Computing. I was also able to get an A+ 
                as my overall grade for the course.<br><br>
                I am a curious being who is also a fast learner, aspiring to build a career with an organisation of repute which offers oppurtunity to grow and 
                where I can use and further develop professional skills while getting a high level of satisfaction and recognition.
