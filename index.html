                <p><h2>About</h2><br>I am Akshita Parasrampuria, a Data Scientist with a strong academic background in Finance, Tax, Accounts and Costing from a 
                  Chartered Accountancy degree from India (US CPA equivalent). I recently graduated from a 6-month immersive Data Analytics Certification from

                    While pursuing graduation and Chartered Accountancy, I was also working full-time at a CA firm (Indore, India) for 3 years as an intern where I

                    After completing CA, I worked for IDFC First Bank (Mumbai, India) as a Loan Credit Manager in Retail Loans where I gained insight about the 
                    banking industry, understood prevailing patterns in various businesses and geographies, performed credit risk analysis for advances from INR 100 
                    thousand upto INR 6 million for pan-India applicants, detail analysis of financial statements including calculation of financial ratios,

                     Fraud, developed own skills, trained juniors in a fast paced manner. <br><br> 
                    While at the Bank as I worked closely with the product team during a system transition, giving constant feedback and suggestions 
                    to improve the system, I realised the importance of technology and developed interest in understanding the process and concepts involved and 
                    hence decided to pursue the Data Analytics course where we dove into fields of programming, visualizing, machine learning, big data and web

                    as my overall grade for the course.<br><br>
                    I am a curious being who is also a fast learner, aspiring to build a career with an organisation of repute which offers oppurtunity to grow and where I can use and further develop professional skills while getting a high level of satisfaction and recognition.
